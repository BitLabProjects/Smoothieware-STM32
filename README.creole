== STM32
This repository holds a modified version of Smoothieware which works with a NUCLEO F401RE: https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/ST-Nucleo-F401RE/

This repository is forked from [[https://github.com/clementleger/Smoothieware-STM32]] which began the work to port Smoothieware to the NUCLEO F411RE board.

==Overview
Smoothie is a free, opensource, high performance G-code interpreter and CNC controller written in Object-Oriented C++ for the LPC17xx micro-controller ( ARM Cortex M3 architecture ). It will run on a mBed, a LPCXpresso, a SmoothieBoard, R2C2 or any other LPC17xx-based board. The motion control part is a port of the awesome grbl.

Documentation can be found here : [[http://smoothieware.org/]]

NOTE it is not necessary to build Smoothie yourself unless you want to (As long as you have one of the officially supported boards, the Nucleo board is not). Prebuilt binaries are availble here http://builds.smoothieware.org/

==Quick Start
In this section you will clone the Smoothieware-STM32 repository and download the necessary files to build it.
===Prerequisites:
* A git client installed
===Windows
* Launch a command line in a directory (E.g.: C:\Dev\) 
* Pull down a clone of the Smoothie github project to your local machine (this guide will use a folder named Smoothieware-STM32)
{{{
git clone https://github.com/BitLabProjects/Smoothieware-STM32.git Smoothieware-STM32
}}}
* Enter the folder and initialize the gcc4mbed submodule
{{{
cd Smoothieware-STM32
git submodule init
git submodule update
}}}
* Download the binaries of GCC to compile for the ARM platform. This steps might take a while, as it also builds the gcc4mbed samples for all the platforms
{{{
cd gcc4arm
win_install.bat
cd ..
}}}

* Done! You now have everything needed to build Smoothieware-STM32, proceed with the 'Building Smoothie' guide

==Building Smoothie
* Launch a command line in the clone directory (E.g.: C:\Dev\Smoothieware-STM32\)
* Launch the script to initialize the build environment variables for the current command line
{{{
gcc4mbed\BuildShell.cmd
}}}
* Build!
{{{
make all
}}}

* Now you can copy the compiled file to the drive (E.g.: The drive F:)
{{{
copy src\NUCLEO_F401RE\main.bin F:
}}}
